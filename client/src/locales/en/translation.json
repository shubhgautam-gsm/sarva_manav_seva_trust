    "services_summary": "Our organization, Shri Manav Seva Sarvajanik Trust, Rajkot, operated by Shri Jaysiyaram Jaybalaji Jaygurudev Hospital Seva Mandal and its collaborating organization, Shri Nakalank Seva Charitable Trust, Rajkot, has been the only organization providing pure, sattvic and nutritious tea, milk, snacks and meals free of cost, 365 days a year, in the morning, afternoon and evening for the relatives taking care of the patients at the Government-run Pandit Dindayal Civil Hospital, Padmakunvarba Gundawadi Hospital and Rasul Khan Zanana Hospital in Rajkot since 1987. It is providing all kinds of necessary medical assistance to the patients arriving for treatment from all over Saurashtra, such as medicines, injections, laboratory, X-ray, CT scan, MRI, blood donation as well as organizing blood donation camps for the blood bank of the Civil Hospital. We provide free vehicle arrangements to bring and drop off patients and to transport the body to the appropriate place. Thalassemia patients who come to the Civil Hospital for blood transfusions are also given bus fare to go home. We are also running a library for the Civil staff and celebrating Nurses' Day and Doctors' Day. Not only that, during natural calamities like earthquakes, swine flu or Corona, the organization has been working day and night for human service with the government and hospital authorities as per the requirement. The organization provides necessary equipment like beds, wheelchairs, latrine chairs, walkers, water beds, air beds, diapers, oxygen concentrator machines, ventilators etc. to the patients free of cost and without any deposit. The government and the hospital authorities are offering and continue to offer invaluable contributions to this human service Yagya (noble work) of the organization. The hospital authorities, out of humanity, have given space for a kitchen in Gundawadi and Zanana hospitals and built a temporary shed and given written permission to build a shed on the space in the Civil Hospital, so the kitchen has been prepared at that place by spending on it themselves. The government and the hospital authorities have never expressed any institutional sentiment on the space given to us. But we just want to say that the organization has not done any kind of illegal encroachment on the place where this human service Yagya is ignited. Therefore, before making any inappropriate public comments or accusations about our organization, please try to know the truth. So far, more than one and three quarter crore (1.75 crore) Daridranarayans have taken advantage of the Prabhu Prasad from the organization. This year, in addition to that, the organization has planned that more than five thousand new Daridranarayans can take advantage of the Prabhu Prasad. In this organization, volunteers from the smallest person in the society to businessmen, factory owners, officers, employees, housewives and daughters come regularly every day to serve. Some volunteers have been associated with the organization for twenty-five years or more. Many volunteers have been associated with the organization for two-three generations. Currently, 200 to 250 volunteers are associated with the organization."

    "financials_and_operations": "The administrative cost of any other organization is 30 to 50 percent. So only 50 to 70 percent of the donation amount is spent on the beneficiaries. Currently, meals for 1000 to 1200 beneficiaries are prepared daily. There are only 5 sisters, 1 rickshaw driver and 1 accountant as paid staff for cooking in the organization. Cooking and serving Prabhu Prasad and other daily activities of the organization are done by 50 to 60 volunteers every day. This way, the beneficiaries get a return of one and a quarter rupees from a donation of one rupee. The administrative cost of the organization is zero compared to other organizations, which is remarkable. Our organization also has a license from the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India for many years. Our organization strictly follows its rules. We know that hungry people are the incarnation of God. We know that those to whom we give Prabhu Prasad are God himself, so we take special care of the quality of the food. The organization gets its accounts audited by a CA and also files income tax returns on time. The organization also accepts a donation of 2 kg of khichdi or one kg of ghee from the small or middle class. Since the organization has 80 G and CSR numbers, the donation from big philanthropists and companies of the society is always received by the grace of God. The organization is moving towards professional management so that more transparency can be brought into the administration and the board can take decisions independently, which gives priority to credibility. In the interest of humanity and for the vast public good, the organization has always stayed away from publicity and is serving the government, hospital authorities and the patients and their relatives who have come for treatment, without asking for any kind of public fund, donation or grant, in the spirit of being a mere instrument. For which this organization is and will be indebted to all those who have shown compassion. A heartfelt prayer to God that we all may continue to receive the constant inspiration, power and ability to provide the best and selfless service to the Daridranarayan. A mere instrument. With regards from all the trustees on behalf of the Jaysiyaram Jaybalaji Jaygurudev Hospital Seva Mandal family."
